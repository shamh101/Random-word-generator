# Random-word-generator

Given training data, creates a random representation of that data with similar properties as the original source
Accomplished by using a Markov Chain implemented by a directed acyclic graph in which each node represents the current state and each edge represents a potential next state with an edge weight as the probability of reaching that next state.
